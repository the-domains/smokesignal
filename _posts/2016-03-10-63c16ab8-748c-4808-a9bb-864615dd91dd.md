_Back to the Future with Sales _

No matter how robotic and technologically advanced our world gets the need for human to human sales will always exist. As we transition from a retirng baby boomer generation to a milennial one what will the future of sales look like? One thing that has already changed is we've shifted from a textbook carsalesman approach to a more consultative approach. Many of you read that with a sigh of relief and I don't blame you. In fact, we've seen "disrupter" brands like Carvanna completely redefine how the car buying experience is done all together. They bypass the person to person experience all together. You can order a car online, someone will deliver it to you and you have a week to try it out. Goodbye sleezy guy with the exposed chest hair, gold necklaces, and book full of one liners.
